This article explains how to migrate from [Adobe Acrobat Automation](/pdf/net/printing-pdf-document/) to [Aspose.PDF for .NET](/pdf/net/printing-pdf-document/) to print a PDF file.

Adobe Acrobat Automation allows you to perform various tasks on PDF files in your code. Aspose.PDF for .NET also provides the functionality to perform PDF manipulation programmatically. However, Aspose.PDF for .NET is easy to use compared to Adobe Acrobat Automation. Aspose.PDF for .NET is built using managed code and can be installed and deployed as a single .NET assembly: Adobe Acrobat Automation is based upon COM components that have to be registered on the machine theyâ€™re being used on. Please note that Aspose.PDF for .NET is fully supported on 32-bit and 64-bit machines and it is also quite fast compared to Adobe Acrobat Automation.

We have selected a simple example to help you understand migration from Adobe Acrobat Automation to [Aspose.PDF for .NET](/pdf/net/). This example shows how to print a PDF file using both methods.
