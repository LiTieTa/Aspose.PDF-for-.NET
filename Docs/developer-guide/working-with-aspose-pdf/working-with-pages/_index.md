 ## **Working with Pages**
.NET applications built for working with PDF files need to have some commonly used functionality such as split and merge pdf documents, extract pages from a PDF file, Insert and remove pages from a PDF file and so on. Aspose.PDF for .NET lets you perform these operations with simple lines of code based on the Document Object Model it follows. This section provides powerful features of the API for working with PDF pages and page properties.
