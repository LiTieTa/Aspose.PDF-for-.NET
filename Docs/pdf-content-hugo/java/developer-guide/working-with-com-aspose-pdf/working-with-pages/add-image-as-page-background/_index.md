Background images can be used to add a watermark, or other subtle design, to documents. In Aspose.PDF for Java, each PDF document is a collection of pages and each page contains a collection of artifacts. The [BackgroundArtifact](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/pdf/com.aspose.pdf/BackgroundArtifact) class can be used to add a background image to a page object.
