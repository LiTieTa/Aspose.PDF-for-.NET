This API shows warning when fonts are substituted. This is a useful feature in tests, as it allows the tests to fail faster if the font is missing, rather than having to track down why the result looks incorrect. In order to cater this requirement, please use the following code snippet where [Document](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/pdf/com.aspose.pdf/Document) class gets notified when fonts substitute.
