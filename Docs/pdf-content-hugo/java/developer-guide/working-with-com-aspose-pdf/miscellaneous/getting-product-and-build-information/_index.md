Sometimes, developers need to get information about the component used in their code. Aspose.PDF for Java contains the [BuildVersionInfo](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/pdf/com.aspose.pdf/BuildVersionInfo) class which provides three static members: PRODUCT, FILE_VERSION and ASSEMBLY_VERSION. These members can be used to get information about the component.
