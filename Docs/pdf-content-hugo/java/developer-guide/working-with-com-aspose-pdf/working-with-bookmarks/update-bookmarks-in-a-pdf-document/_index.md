To update a bookmark in a PDF file, first get the particular bookmark from the [Document](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/pdf/com.aspose.pdf/Document) object's [OutlineCollection](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/pdf/com.aspose.pdf/OutlineCollection) collection by specifying the bookmark's index. Once you have retrieved the bookmark into the [OutlineCollection](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/pdf/com.aspose.pdf/OutlineCollection) object, you can update its properties and then save the updated PDF file using the save method.
