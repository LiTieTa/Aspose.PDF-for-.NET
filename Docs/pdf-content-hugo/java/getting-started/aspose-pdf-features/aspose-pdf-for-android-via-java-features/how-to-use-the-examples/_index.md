Firstly make sure that you have the ADT bundle installed and that you have downloaded and extracted the latest version of [Aspose.PDF for Android via Java](https://repository.aspose.com/webapp/#/artifacts/browse/tree/General/repo/com/aspose/aspose-pdf-android-via-java).

- Extract the **aspose-pdf-X.X.X.jar** from the latest release archive and add it to a new folder under the example you want to run. Add the file under a folder called **libs**.
- Open the project in your workspace using Eclipse with ADT.
- Click **Run** to start and choose the appropriate emulator to run the package on.
