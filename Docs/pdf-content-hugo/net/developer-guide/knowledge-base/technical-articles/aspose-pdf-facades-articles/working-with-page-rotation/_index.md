[PdfPageEditor](http://www.aspose.com/api/net/pdf/aspose.pdf.facades/PdfPageEditor) class provides the facility to rotate a page. In this technical tip, we will see how we can rotate a page. We will rotate multiple pages at once. Also, we’ll see how we can find that how much a page has been rotated. To make it more interesting, we’ll rotate odd pages at 180 degrees, and even pages at 270 degrees.
