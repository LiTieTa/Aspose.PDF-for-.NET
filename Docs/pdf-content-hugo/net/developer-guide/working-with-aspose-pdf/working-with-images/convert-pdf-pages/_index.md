### **Set UseFontHinting while converting PDF to PNG**
Aspose.Pdf.RenderingOptions class has a property UseFontHinting of type boolean, which can be used to turn on the font hinting mechanism. Font hinting is basically the use of mathematical instructions to adjust the display of an outline font. In some cases, turning this flag on may solve problems with text legibility. For now, usage of this flag could give effect only for TTF fonts, if these fonts are using in source document. Following code snippet shows the usage of UseFontHinting property:

### **Use Bradley algorithm during conversion**
Aspose.PDF for .NET has been supporting the feature to convert PDF to TIF using LZW compression and then with the use of AForge, Binarization can be applied. However one of the customers requested that for some images, they need to get the Threshold using Otsu, so they also would like to use Bradley.

## **Convert an Image to PDF**
Images are often used to clarify or illustrate data and are often shared between colleagues. Sharing images in PDF format is a convenient way to ensure that everyone can view them. To this end, Aspose.PDF for .NET supports converting images to PDF. The following table shows the image formats that Aspose.PDF can convert to PDF.

|**Image File Types**|**Description**|
| :- | :- |
|CCITT|CCITT is a lossless image compression method used in Group 4 fax machines. It is used for black and white images only.|
|GIF|Graphics Interchange Format, a bitmap image format frequently used on the web, uses lossless compression.|
|JPEG|Joint Photographic Experts Group is a lossy compression method for digital images, developed for use with digital photography.|
|PNG|Portable Network Graphics is an improved, non-patented replacement for GIF and is a popular lossless image compression format used on the web.|
|TIFF|Tagged Image File Format is a file format for storing raster graphics. It is widely used in word processing and digital image manipulation applications.|
|BMP|The bitmap file format is a raster graphics image format used to store digital images. It is created to be device-independent.|
|EMF|Enhanced Meta File is a 32-bit version of Microsoft's Windows Meta File format.|
|Exif|Exchangeable Image File format specifies formats for images, sound and other tags used by digital cameras, smartphones and other devices.|

### **Aspose.PDF Image Approach**
A PDF document comprises pages and each page contains one or more paragraph objects. A paragraph can be a text, image, table, floating box, graph, heading, form field or an attachment. To convert an image file into PDF format, enclose it in a paragraph.

It is possible to convert images at a physical location on the local hard drive, found at a web URL or in a MemoryStream. To add an image:

1. Create an object of the Image class.
1. Add the image to a page's Paragraphs collection.
1. Specify the file's path or source.
   1. If an image is at a location on the hard drive, specify the path location using the Image.File property.
1. If an image is placed in a MemoryStream, pass the object holding the image to the Image.ImageStream property.

The following code snippet shows how to load an image object, get its dimensions, set the page dimensions according to image dimensions, place the image on a page in a PDF file and save the output as PDF.

## **Convert a particular page region to Image (DOM)**
We can convert PDF documents to different Image formats using image devices objects of Aspose.PDF. However, sometimes there is a requirement to convert a particular page region into Image format. We can fulfill this requirement in two steps. Initially crop the PDF page to the desired region and later convert it to image using the desired Image device object.

Following code demonstrates how to convert a particular page region to PNG using PNGDevice.

Please note left bottom is page origin i.e. (0,0) and Aspose.PDF measuring unit is point
1 inch = 72 points and 1 cm = 1/2.54 inch = 0.3937 inch = 28.3 points.
