### **Product Description**
To create PDF documents, Aspose.PDF for JasperReports relies on a built-in version of [Aspose.PDF for Java](http://www.aspose.com/categories/java-components/aspose.pdf-for-java/default.aspx), the market-leading library from Aspose. Adobe Acrobat Professional does not have to be installed on the system to generate PDF documents with Aspose.PDF for JasperReports.
