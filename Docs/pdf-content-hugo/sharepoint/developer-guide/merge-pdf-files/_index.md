Merging/concatenating of multiple PDF files into a single PDF file is very popular and demanding feature in PDF file processing applications. We have introduced this important feature in [Aspose.PDF for SharePoint 2.2.0](http://www.aspose.com/community/files/73/sharepoint-components/aspose.pdf-for-sharepoint/entry679427.aspx) version. Merging two files is, creating a single file by adding second file to the end of first file.
