In this hotfix, page numbering is improved in order to make Word2Pdf work better.1) A new property “IsPageNumberForDocument”is added to Pdf class. If this property is set to true, the "$P" symbol will be replaced by the total page number of the document. Otherwise "$P" will be replaced with the total page number of all sections that were not restarted ("IsPageNumberRestarted" is set to true). 2) A new property “StartingPageNumber” is added to Section class. This property is used to set the starting page number of the section.3) Processing of column is improved.
