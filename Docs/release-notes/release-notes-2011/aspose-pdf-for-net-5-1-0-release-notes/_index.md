We are glad to announce the release of another version of Aspose.PDF for .NET. Some of the issues reported earlier have fixed along with some new features like creation of more than one TOC (Table Of Contents), specifying various background color information for each heading in TOC etc, have also be introduced. As compare to earlier versions, the HTML to PDF conversion feature has become more stable.
